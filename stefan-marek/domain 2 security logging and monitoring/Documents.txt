SSM documents:
    AWS Systems Manager (SSM) documents are used to define the actions and parameters for tasks you want to perform on your AWS resources. They are essential for automating and managing various operational tasks on your AWS infrastructure. Here are some specific uses:
    Running Scripts: Execute shell scripts on Linux instances or PowerShell scripts on Windows instances.
    Patching: Apply patch baselines to keep your instances up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    Software Management: Install, uninstall, or update software packages on your instances.
    Configuration Management: Configure applications and services, such as Docker or AWS Directory Service.
    Automation: Automate routine tasks, such as updating the SSM Agent or running custom automation workflows.
    Security: Enforce security policies and compliance by running predefined or custom scripts.
    Monitoring and Logging: Collect and analyze logs and metrics from your instances.
