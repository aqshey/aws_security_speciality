SSM run command

The ssm run command feature in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) allows you to remotely execute commands on your managed instances.
This is useful for automating common administrative tasks and managing your instances without needing to log in to each one individually.
The run command feature supports both shell scripts for Linux instances and PowerShell scripts for Windows instances.
You can run commands on individual instances, groups of instances, or all instances in your account.

example usage:
```
aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" --targets "Key=tag:Name,Values=MyInstance" --parameters commands="echo Hello, World!"
```
To manage the ec2 instance from ssm you need iam role.
