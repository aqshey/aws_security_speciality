Eventbridge:
1. EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services.
2. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources, such as application and custom integrations, and routes that data to targets like AWS Lambda.
3. EventBridge is the next evolution of Amazon CloudWatch Events and is designed to make it easy to build event-driven applications.
4. EventBridge allows you to create rules that match incoming events and route them to targets for processing.
5. EventBridge supports a wide range of event sources and targets, making it easy to integrate with your existing applications and services.
6. EventBridge is a fully managed service that automatically scales to handle the volume of events in your environment.

schedule:
1. EventBridge allows you to create rules that match incoming events and route them to targets for processing.
2. You can use EventBridge rules to schedule events to run at specific times or on a recurring basis.
3. For example, you can create a rule that triggers an AWS Lambda function to run every hour to perform a specific task.



Terraform code to create an eventbridge rule for sending SNS notification when an ec2 instance is stopped:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "stop_instance_rule" {
  name        = "stop_instance_rule"
  description = "Rule to send SNS notification when an ec2 instance is stopped"
  schedule_expression = "event['detail-type'] == 'EC2 Instance State-change Notification' && event['detail']['state'] == 'stopped'"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_target" "stop_instance_target" {
  rule      = aws_cloudwatch_event_rule.stop_instance_rule.name
  target_id = "send_sns_notification"
  arn       = aws_sns_topic.sns_topic.arn
}
```
IAM permission required for eventbridge rule:
