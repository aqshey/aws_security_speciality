SSM automations:
   1.  AWS Systems Manager (SSM) automations are predefined workflows that you can use to perform common administrative tasks on your AWS resources.
    They are designed to simplify the process of managing your infrastructure and applications by providing a set of predefined steps that you can execute
    without needing to write custom scripts. Here are some key features of SSM automations:
    2. Predefined Workflows: Automations are predefined workflows that you can use to perform common administrative tasks, such as patching,
    software installation, and configuration management.
    Easy to Use: Automations are easy to use and require minimal configuration. You can run them with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console or
    using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).


Automation Runbook:
    ssm documents of type automation are called runbooks. They are used to define the steps and parameters for automating common administrative tasks
    on your AWS resources. Runbooks are similar to SSM documents, but they are specifically designed for automating workflows and processes. Here are
    some key features of runbooks:
    Predefined Steps: Runbooks contain predefined steps that you can use to automate common administrative tasks, such as patching, software
    installation, and configuration management.
    Input Parameters: Runbooks can accept input parameters that allow you to customize the execution of the workflow. You can specify parameters
    such as instance IDs, package names, and configuration settings.
    Secure: Runbooks are secure and integrate with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control. You can control who
    has permission to execute runbooks and what actions they can perform.
    can be triggered manually or scheduled to run at a specific time or on a recurring basis.
    by eventbridge rules
    on a schedule using maintenance windows.

    for example:
    {
        "schemaVersion": "0.3",
        "description": "Install a package on an instance",
        "parameters": {
            "packageName": {
                "type": "String",
                "description": "The name of the package to install"
            }
        },
        "mainSteps": [
            {
                "action": "aws:runShellScript",
                "name": "runShellScript",
                "inputs": {
                    "runCommand": [
                        "sudo yum install -y {{packageName}}"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
