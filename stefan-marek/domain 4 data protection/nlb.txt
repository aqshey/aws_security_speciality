NLB:
Key points in shorts and sweet:
1. Network Load Balancer (NLB) is a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming traffic
   across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.
2. NLB is designed to handle high volumes of traffic and provides low latency and high throughput.
3. NLB supports static IP addresses, which can be used to route traffic to specific targets or to maintain
   session persistence for clients.
4. NLB can be used to load balance TCP and UDP traffic, such as HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP, across multiple


Client IP preservation:
1. NLB supports preserving the client IP address in the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header for TCP traffic.
2. This allows the target to see the original client IP address and make decisions based on the client's location
   or identity.

default settings:
1. NLB uses a flow hash algorithm to distribute traffic across targets in a target group.
2. NLB supports health checks to monitor the health of targets and route traffic only to healthy targets.
3. NLB can be used with AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of targets based on traffic
   patterns and demand.

Cross-zone load balancing:
1. NLB supports cross-zone load balancing, which allows traffic to be distributed evenly across all targets in
   all Availability Zones.
2. This helps to ensure that traffic is evenly distributed and that targets are used efficiently.

Connection draining:
1. NLB supports connection draining, which allows in-flight requests to complete before a target is
   deregistered.
2. This helps to ensure that clients do not experience interruptions in service when a target is removed from
    the load balancer.

Monitoring and logging:
1. NLB provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests and responses processed by the
   load balancer.
2. NLB can be integrated with Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of the load balancer
    and targets.
