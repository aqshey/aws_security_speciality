SSL TLS:

1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide
   secure communications over a computer network. SSL was originally developed by Netscape and released in 1995.
   TLS is the successor to SSL and the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably.

configuring SSL/TLS for ELB:

- ELB supports SSL/TLS termination, which allows you to offload the SSL/TLS encryption and decryption
  process from your application servers to the load balancer.

public ssl certificate are issued by
1. Certificate Authority (CA)
2. Self-signed certificate

CA examples:
    1. Let's Encrypt
    2. DigiCert
    3. Comodo
    4. GlobalSign
    5. GoDaddy
    6. Symantec
    7. Thawte
    8. VeriSign


HTTPS listener:
    security policy:
        a combination of ssl protocols and ciphers that are used to secure connections between clients and the
        load balancer.
        - ELB provides predefined security policies that adhere to industry best practices.

    For ALB NLB:
        frontend connection:
            - The frontend connection is the connection between the client and the load balancer.
            - The security policy determines the protocols and ciphers that the client and load balancer use to
              communicate.
        backend connection:
            - The backend connection is the connection between the load balancer and the target.
            - The security policy determines the protocols and ciphers that the load balancer and target use to
              communicate.
