ELB sticky session:
- ELB supports sticky sessions, which bind a user's session to a specific instance. This is useful for
  applications that require a user to stick to the same instance for the duration of their session.
- Sticky sessions are enabled by creating a cookie that contains the session ID. The cookie is then
  inserted into the response from the load balancer to the client.
- When the client sends a request to the load balancer, the load balancer uses the cookie to route the
  request to the correct instance.
