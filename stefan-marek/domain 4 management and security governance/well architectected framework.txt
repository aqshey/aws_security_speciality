well architected framework:
    6 pillars
        1. operational excellence
        2. security
        3. reliability
        4. performance efficiency
        5. cost optimization
        6. sustainability

        They are not something to balance. or tradeoffs. they are synergy
        - operational excellence: focus on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improving processes and procedures.
        - security: focus on protecting information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
        - reliability: focus on ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to.
        - performance efficiency: focus on using IT and computing resources efficiently.
        - cost optimization: focus on avoiding unnecessary costs.
        - sustainability: focus on the environmental impact of your workloads.

        if you focus on operational excellancy then automatically it will result in cost optimization. as
        your architecture will become more efficient and consumes less cost.
