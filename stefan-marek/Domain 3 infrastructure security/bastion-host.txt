Bastion host:
1. A bastion host is a server that is designed to provide secure access to a private network from an external
   network, such as the internet.
2. It acts as a gateway between users on the internet and resources in the private network, allowing users to
   securely access and manage the resources without exposing them to the internet.
3. Bastion hosts are typically deployed in a public subnet of a VPC and are used to access resources in private
   subnets using SSH or RDP.
4. Bastion hosts are hardened and secured to prevent unauthorized access and protect the private network from
    external threats.
5. Bastion hosts can be used to:
    - Securely access instances in private subnets.
    - Monitor and manage resources in private subnets.
    - Control access to resources in private subnets.

we can use bastion host to:
    1. Securely access instances in private subnets.
    2. Monitor and manage resources in private subnets.
    3. Control access to resources in private subnets.

security groups structure of private subnet and public subnet should be like :

private subnet:
    - allow inbound traffic only from the bastion host.
    - allow outbound traffic to the internet for software updates and patches.
    - restrict inbound and outbound traffic to specific IP addresses or ranges.
public subnet:
    - allow inbound traffic from the internet for public-facing services.
    - allow outbound traffic to the internet for software updates and patches.
    - restrict inbound and outbound traffic to specific IP addresses or ranges.
