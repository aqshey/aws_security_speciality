VPC endpoint:
1. A VPC endpoint is a private connection between your VPC and another AWS service, such as S3, DynamoDB,
    or Kinesis.
2. It allows you to access the AWS service without using an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection.
3. VPC endpoints are used to secure and simplify the connection between your VPC and the AWS service.
4. There are two types of VPC endpoints:
    - Gateway endpoints: Used to connect your VPC to S3 and DynamoDB.
    - Interface endpoints: Used to connect your VPC to other AWS services, such as Kinesis and CloudWatch.

Things needed to create VPC endpoint:
1. VPC:
    - A VPC is required to create a VPC endpoint.
    - The VPC defines the network settings for the VPC endpoint.
2. Subnets:
    - Subnets are required to create a VPC endpoint.
    - The subnets define the availability zones in which the VPC endpoint is created.
3. Route Tables:
    - Route tables are required to route traffic to the VPC endpoint.
    - The route tables define the routes for the VPC endpoint.
4. Security Groups:
    - Security groups are used to control the traffic that is allowed to flow through the VPC endpoint.
    - Inbound and outbound rules can be configured to allow or deny traffic based on the source and destination IP addresses and ports.
5. VPC Endpoint Policy:
    - A VPC endpoint policy is used to control access to the VPC endpoint.
    - The policy defines the permissions for the VPC endpoint, such as which resources can access the endpoint and what actions they can perform.
6. DNS Resolution:
    - DNS resolution is used to resolve the DNS names of the AWS services through the VPC endpoint.
    - DNS resolution must be enabled for the VPC endpoint to work properly.
7. Private DNS Names:
    - Private DNS names are used to resolve the DNS names of the AWS services through the VPC endpoint.
    - Private DNS names must be enabled for the VPC endpoint to work properly.
8. Endpoint Services:
    - Endpoint services are used to create and manage the VPC endpoints.
    - The endpoint services provide the APIs and tools to create, update, and delete VPC endpoints.
9. Monitoring and Logging:
    - Monitoring and logging are used to track the traffic and usage of the VPC endpoint.
    - CloudWatch logs and metrics can be used to monitor the VPC endpoint and detect any issues or anomalies.
10. Encryption:
    - Encryption is used to secure the data transmitted over the VPC endpoint.
    - The data is encrypted using SSL/TLS to protect it from eavesdropping and tampering.
11. Access Control:
    - Access control is used to restrict access to the VPC endpoint.
    - IAM policies can be used to control which users and resources can access the VPC endpoint and what actions they can perform.
