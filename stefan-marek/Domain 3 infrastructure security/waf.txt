Web Application Firewall:
1. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security service that protects web applications from common web-based attacks.
2. It filters and monitors HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet, allowing you to control which traffic is allowed or blocked.
3. WAF can be used to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks.
4. WAF can be deployed in front of web applications hosted on Amazon CloudFront, Application Load Balancer, or API Gateway.
5. WAF rules can be created to block or allow traffic based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, URI strings, or request methods.
6. WAF provides real-time visibility into web traffic and security events, allowing you to monitor and respond to potential threats.
